47,Beatrix,Yeah. Wouldn't you be down too if you saw a comrade die?,啊…巴萨拉卡看到同伴死去，换成是你也会很沮丧吧？
48,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,This definitely is no ordinary situation. Is that why you suggested rendezvousing with 姬塔 and the others?,这确实和平时不太一样。 所以你才想让我见<span class='scene-font-katari'>姬塔</span>他们。
49,Beatrix,"Yep. At a time like this, that guy's death will haunt him to no end.",是的。 在这种时候，会一直回想着那个死去的人，对吧？
50,Beatrix,"It takes time to deal with sadness, but too much of it can overshadow everything else.",长时间的悲伤是可以的…但是，如果只顾着悲伤的话，就看不到其他的事情了。

56,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,But Vaseraga didn't explicitly say no either. I think your good intentions reached him in a way.,但巴萨拉卡没有拒绝。 至少，你的想法和感受已经传达了吧。
57,Beatrix,Hopefully...,…希望如此…
63,Zeta/泽塔,"Mm... Nothing beats a nice, peaceful town.",啊……果然，和平的街道也不错啊。
64,Beatrix,Don't tell me you're looking to shop or something.,难道泽塔，你是想买东西什么的？
65,Zeta/泽塔,"Sure, why not after all that's happened? It'll let me take my mind off things.",嗯？ 是啊……毕竟发生了这么多事。希望我们可以一起散心。
66,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,After we finish our business first. Until then behave yourselves.,要在这件事结束之后。自重些。
67,Beatrix,"Pfft, you don't have to tell me that! It's not like I brought Zeta here so that we could goof off or anything!",我，我知道！我又不是来跟泽塔玩的！
68,Zeta/泽塔,"Hehe... You're relieved Ilsa's not around, aren't ya, Bea?",呵呵……小贝，没有伊尔莎了，你应该松了一口气吧。
69,Beatrix,"N-no, who said anything about that? I'm not suffering from the trauma of her training! No siree!",不，不是那样的！我可没因为训练生时代留下什么创伤！

77,Beatrix,Really? Are you close to Ilsa?,原…原来是这样……呐，尤斯缇斯和伊尔莎教官关系亲密吗？
78,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,We both joined the Society around the same time. That's all.,同一时期进入组织，仅此而已。
79,Beatrix,When did you notice that about her?,呐，伊尔莎什么时候变成这样了？
80,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,I'm not entirely sure. You can ask Vaseraga about her later.,不知道，我不知道细节。回头再去问巴萨拉卡吧。
81,Zeta/泽塔,He knows the old Ilsa too?,那家伙也了解以前的伊尔莎……？
82,Zeta/泽塔,What's his story?," 那，巴萨拉卡呢？"

86,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,But this time it was out of his hands.,但是，这次没有成功…
87,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,"Whenever he loses a comrade, he conditions his body. This is an act of penance in his mind.",每次失去同伴，他的身体就好像跟“身体改造”完全没了关系似的。
88,Zeta/泽塔,"Penance, huh? Judging from his appearance, he must've been conditioning himself for a long time. We all have skeletons in our past, don't we?",是的，是的。他花了很长时间改造了一些东西，我想知道他在过去发生了什么。
89,,Zeta wonders what could have happened to Vaseraga back then.,<span class='scene-font-katari'>泽塔也察觉到巴萨拉卡过去好像发生过什么事。</span>
90,,"But since she has no interest in piecing together speculation, she changes the subject.",<span class='scene-font-katari'>泽塔觉得对此进行猜测也不是兴趣所在，于是中断了对话。</span>
91,Zeta/泽塔,Guess I'd better get ready too. My current gear just doesn't cut it.,那么……那么，我大概也准备好了。 我们现在的装备可不怎么好啊。
92,,"And with that, Zeta and the others head to the Knickknack Shack to purchase equipment.",<span class='scene-font-katari'>就这样，泽塔一行一起前往杂货店买装备去了。</span>
