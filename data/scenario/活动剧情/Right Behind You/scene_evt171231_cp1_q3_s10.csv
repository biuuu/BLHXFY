46,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,Are you worried about him?,你担心巴萨拉卡吧。
47,Beatrix,Yeah. Wouldn't you be down too if you saw a comrade die?,啊...巴萨拉卡看到同伴死去，换成是你也会很沮丧吧？
48,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,This definitely is no ordinary situation. Is that why you suggested rendezvousing with 姬塔 and the others?,这确实和平时不太一样。 所以你才想让我见<span class='scene-font-katari'>姬塔</span>他们。
49,Beatrix,"Yep. At a time like this, that guy's death will haunt him to no end.",是的。 在这种时候，会一直回想着那个死去的人，对吧？
50,Beatrix,"It takes time to deal with sadness, but too much of it can overshadow everything else.",长时间的悲伤是可以的...但是，如果只顾着悲伤的话，就看不到其他的事情了。

55,Beatrix,"Oh... Yeah, I guess so...",唔......这，这样啊......果然是这样啊......
56,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,But Vaseraga didn't explicitly say no either. I think your good intentions reached him in a way.,但巴萨拉卡没有拒绝。 至少，你的想法和感受已经传达了吧。
57,Beatrix,Hopefully...,...希望如此...
63,Zeta/泽塔,"Mm... Nothing beats a nice, peaceful town.",啊......果然，和平的街道也不错啊。
64,Beatrix,Don't tell me you're looking to shop or something.,难道泽塔，你是想买东西什么的？
65,Zeta/泽塔,"Sure, why not after all that's happened? It'll let me take my mind off things.",嗯？ 是啊......毕竟发生了这么多事。希望我们可以一起散心。
66,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,After we finish our business first. Until then behave yourselves.,要在这件事结束之后。自重些。
67,Beatrix,"Pfft, you don't have to tell me that! It's not like I brought Zeta here so that we could goof off or anything!",我，我知道！我又不是来跟泽塔玩的！
68,Zeta/泽塔,"Hehe... You're relieved Ilsa's not around, aren't ya, Bea?",呵呵......小贝，没有伊尔莎了，你应该松了一口气吧。
69,Beatrix,"N-no, who said anything about that? I'm not suffering from the trauma of her training! No siree!",不，不是那样的！我可没因为训练生时代留下什么创伤！

77,Beatrix,Really? Are you close to Ilsa?,原...原来是这样......呐，尤斯缇斯和伊尔莎教官关系亲密吗？
78,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,We both joined the Society around the same time. That's all.,同一时期进入组织，仅此而已。
79,Beatrix,When did you notice that about her?,呐，伊尔莎什么时候变成这样了？

81,Zeta/泽塔,He knows the old Ilsa too?,那家伙也了解以前的伊尔莎......？
82,Zeta/泽塔,What's his story?, 那，巴萨拉卡呢？
83,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,"He requested a weapon, and it came into his possession. He spoke of how it would bring his physical conditioning to completion.",他收到了我们订购的武器。还说到要以此完成身体的改造。

85,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,"Presumably. After joining the Society, he focused his entire being into ensuring no one would die.",也许吧。自加入这个组织起，他就一直致力于不让任何人死去。
86,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,But this time it was out of his hands.,但是，这次没有成功...
87,Eustace/尤斯缇斯,"Whenever he loses a comrade, he conditions his body. This is an act of penance in his mind.",每次失去同伴，他的身体就好像跟“身体改造”完全没了关系似的。
88,Zeta/泽塔,"Penance, huh? Judging from his appearance, he must've been conditioning himself for a long time. We all have skeletons in our past, don't we?",是的，是的。他花了很长时间改造了一些东西，我想知道他在过去发生了什么。
89,,Zeta wonders what could have happened to Vaseraga back then.,<span class='scene-font-katari'>泽塔也察觉到巴萨拉卡过去好像发生过什么事。</span>
90,,"But since she has no interest in piecing together speculation, she changes the subject.",<span class='scene-font-katari'>泽塔觉得对此进行猜测也不是兴趣所在，于是中断了对话。</span>
91,Zeta/泽塔,Guess I'd better get ready too. My current gear just doesn't cut it.,那么......那么，我大概也准备好了。 我们现在的装备可不怎么好啊。
92,,"And with that, Zeta and the others head to the Knickknack Shack to purchase equipment.",<span class='scene-font-katari'>就这样，泽塔一行一起前往杂货店买装备去了。</span>
